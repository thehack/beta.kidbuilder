puzzlemaker to use layout instead of loading independently
badge/new doesn't work properly yet.
sounds for tile game and puzzle game.
verse fill-in game needs to be broken up into three levels, each a separate entity.

after successful level/new, redirect to /levels.

##Bugs
bug: if puzzle isn't in a level, it's not a unit, so completing it returns a 500 error.
